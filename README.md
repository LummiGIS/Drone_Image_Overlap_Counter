# Drone_Image_Overlap_Counter
Creates a raster whos values are the number of image overlaps at that position.

Python 2.7

This script takes a feature class of polygons that represent the on-ground footprints of drone images (for example, the output of the image footprints script available from Agisoft  https://www.agisoft.com/forum/index.php?topic=2666.0) and creates a raster from those footprints.  This output rasterâ€™s pixel values are the sum of the overlapping image footprints.
This tool was written for ArcGIS 10.7 and requires an ESRI spatial analyst license in addition to the Arcpy library.

Python 2.7
This script takes a feature class of polygons that represent the on-ground footprints of drone images (for example, the output of the image footprints script available from Agisoft) and creates a raster.  This output rasterâ€™s pixel values are the sum of the overlapping image footprints.
This tool was written for ArcGIS 10.7 and requires an ESRI spatial analyst license in addition to the Arcpy library.

# Drone_Image_Overlap_Counter
Creates a raster whos values are the number of image overlaps at that position.

Version exist for ArcGIS (Python 2.7) and ArcGIS Pro (Python 3.x)

This script takes a feature class of polygons that represent the on-ground footprints of drone images (for example, the output of the image footprints script available from Agisoft  https://www.agisoft.com/forum/index.php?topic=2666.0) and creates a raster from those footprints.  This output rasterâ€™s pixel values are the sum of the overlapping image footprints.
These tools  requires an ESRI spatial analyst license and Agisoft Photoscan or Agisoft Metashape.

General Workflow:
Clone or download this repository.

Open your Agisoft Metashape project.

From Metashape go to Tools --> Run Script

Navigate to GetImageFootPrints.py and run with no parameters.

After the footprints are added to your Metashape project go to File --> Export ---> Export Shapes and save your shapefile.

From your favorite Python IDE open CreateImageOverlapCountFromAgisoftFootprintFilePy3.py

Set parameters to the input shapefile, an empty directory to store temp files, the path to the output image overlap count raster, and desired cell size.
